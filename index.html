<h2 style="color:red;">About Korean drama's</h2></p>
<p style="color:white;">Korean drama (Korean: 한국 드라마; RR: Han-guk deurama), also known as Koreanovela or K-drama, refers to Korean-language television shows made in South Korea. These shows began to be produced around the early 1960s, but were mostly consumed domestically until the rise of the Korean Wave in the 1990s. They have since achieved significant international popularity, with dozens of millions of viewers across the world.
<br>The success of Korean dramas has had a significant economic impact on South Korea. In 2022, US$561.3 million of Korean television content was sold abroad, which was a 29.6% increase from the previous year.[7] The industry also employs tens of thousands of people,[8] although its strenuous working conditions have been criticized.[9] Korean dramas have also been cited as a motivation for tourists to visit the country.</p>
